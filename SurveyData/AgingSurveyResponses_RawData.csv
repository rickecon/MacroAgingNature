Q1. What are your timelines for longevity drugs? By when do you believe we'll be able to slow overall biological aging by* 5 years*?,Q2. By when do you believe we'll be able to slow overall biological aging by* 30 years*?,Q3. Is there a ceiling to how much we can extend healthy lifespan?,Q4. How much *funding* will it take to engineer a future where biological aging is reversible by 5 years?,"Q5. In your view, how will biological aging most likely be treated?",Q6. Do you have any moral concerns about longevity research? ,Q7. (*Optional*) What's one R&D area in aging biology you believe is underfunded but could yield extraordinary socio-economic returns if better supported by public/philanthropic funds?

In the last decade or so, developmental biology research globally has been consistently underfunded and undervalued. Trends in research funding is more focused on translational research that can be commercialised. I think both public and philanthropic funds should be geared towards such fundamental research. Our understanding of biological systems and temporal changes will be invaluable."
